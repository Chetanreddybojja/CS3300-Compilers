# CS3300-Compilers
Designed a Macrojava Compiler with the following attributes :
- A compiler was built to translate MacroJava to MIPS assembly. There are five stages for the compiler: Lexical analysis, Type checking, IR generation, Register Allocation and MIPS assembly code generation.
- Flex and Bison were used for the first stage, the other four stages were implemented using JavaCC and JTB.
